## Final project for GEOG6655

This is a structured package for my final project. 

### Structure

`scripts` contains any code that I write to run scripts
    this includes job scripts that I give to slurm for running things on the supercomputer\n
`outputs` contains `manuscript` for writing and `figures` for figures. \n
`data/` contains a script for downloading the data needed for the project, but not the 
    data itself, as that would be much too big. \n
    i may create `sample_data` which does sync one or two files that I can use to show 
    a sample analysis. \n
